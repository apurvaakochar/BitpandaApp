# BitpandaApp

## Example App

### Features

• A scrollable list with the name and symbol of the cryptocurrency 

• On click it shows the price change in the last 7 days and the last 1 day and also the current price against Euro

• It has a **Search Controller** to filter the results based on the name or symbol

• It has an **Indicator View** to show the progress

• It shows an **alert** when data cannot be fetched

• Although including images is a great idea, but unfortunately the mentioned API does not provide any image url 
for the cryptocurrencies. There are however other APIs like “https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/”, which provides image urls along with other data.
To avoid calling another API, for this assignment, I chose not to include an image.

### Architecture

• MVVM was used

• Closures were used to bind the view model (referred as interactor) in this project to the view controller

• Protocols and extensions were used to segregate Presentation Logic from Business Logic

### Unit Test

• An example test case was written to test the binding between view controller and view model.

### UI

• The UI followed the Auto Layout format and appropriate constraints were given to make it suitable for all the iOS devices

### Libraries

[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)

This library was used for networking and parsing. I would have used Kingfisher for image loading, had I shown images.

## Code Sample

[Clean Swift Examples](https://github.com/Clean-Swift/CleanStore)

• This is a beautifully written code. All the Swift powerful tools like protocols, extensions, enums, among others are appropraitely used and taken advantage of.

• It also separates presentation logic. business logic and routing logic

• It is on lines with Uncle Bob's Clean Code

• Although there is no proper room for Reactive Programming, which I have developed strong adoration for in the past few months.

[Clean Swift Examples](https://github.com/Clean-Swift/CleanStore)

• This is a code which i wrote sometime ago follwing View Model and View Controller binding.

• It shows images from the Flickr API and caches them.

## Apps

### UI

•  I believe [Mapify](https://mapify.travel/) has done a great job in terms of desiging and graphics

### Business 

•  [Paytm](https://paytm.com/) has transformmed the definition of Digital money, taking advantage of demonitisation in India.

### Innovation

•  [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/) All time fan of this app!

## What are the first three things you would do if you join us?

• Learn

First I intend to learn more about the APIs, architecture and process flow. If the company follows Agile methodology and if not, Why not? Everyone should work in the Agile manner, right?

Schedule of Continuous integration and deployment

Which person is responsible for what, so i know who to go crying :D

• Play

I believe the greatest ideas come with doodling and I would like to have some time to work with some dummy data

• Code

Then of course, grab a coffee and headphones and maybe sit on a bean bag, do you have bean bags btw?

## What kind of (technical) projects do you work on in your spare time?

• In my spare time, I work on exploring Sketch for coming up with better Graphics.

• I also help some friends with small mobile applications

• I also play with AWS and try to learn more Server Side things

• I am deeply fascinated with machine learning, GIS and Augmented Reality, so I explore the current trends and state of the art in these fields.
